# Junction City

Junction City generates illustrations of freeway junctions in SVG format based on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)â€™s motorway junction tagging conventions. Idealized illustrations of freeway exits are often used in turn-by-turn navigation applications, to display to the user as they approach the exit, as well as in reference works describing highway routes. Junction City generates sign diagrams that can be uploaded to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Diagrams_of_U.S._Interchange_Exit_Direction_Signs) for inclusion in Wikipedia and Wikivoyage articles.

As a starting point, the illustrations attempt to adhere to the _[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/)_ (MUTCD) that is used throughout the United States. Route shields come from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Diagrams_of_road_signs_of_the_United_States). For consistency and familiarity, legends are set in [Roadgeek 2014](https://github.com/sammdot/roadgeek-fonts/), which is embedded as a Web font.

Junction City is a work in progress. Currently, it generates only left- or right-side [Interchange Exit Direction Signs](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2003r1/part2/fig2e-20_longdesc.htm) with optional exit numbers, an optional shield, and one or more legends (control cities, other traffic generators, or road names).
